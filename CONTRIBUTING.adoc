== Git Workflow

=== Pulling & Pushing

__Always__ use `git pull --rebase origin <branch>`! Always! If you have uncommited local changes `git stash` them. This will prevent ugly merge-commits in our `git log` and the need to interactively rebase from time to time.

=== Committing

* Think before you commit! Do not commit incomplete changes. Check wether you are commiting on the right branch.
* Run `cabal configure && cabal build` before you commit! Add new dependencies to `ricochet-haskell.cabal`. Fix compilation errors.
* Split your changes into meaningful commits! If you have got unrelated changes in a file, use `git add -p <file>` to split these into separate commits.
* Write meaningful, grammatically correct commit messages! Use the additional lines to write down all important aspects of the commit.

Tip: If you have commited on the wrong branch, but not pushed yet you can do this:

[source,shell]
----
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git checkout <right branch>
git add <files>
git commit
----

=== Branching

Create a new branch for every new feature or bigger change you develop!

Smaller changes can be made on the master branch if you are sure that they won't conflict with anyone's changes.

We don't have notion of stability yet but code on the master branch should compile at least.

== Code

* Use meaningful function names.
* Use meaningful type names.
* Write as much functional code as possible
* Use two spaces as indentation.
* â€¦

== Communication

Please talk to the people! If everything is coordinated well, development will be much easier.

These are the two communication channels we use:

* Github issues for in depth discussion of concrete problems
* IRC (`#jugendhackt` on freenode) for pretty much everything else (ranging from technical to more general to off-topic discussion)
