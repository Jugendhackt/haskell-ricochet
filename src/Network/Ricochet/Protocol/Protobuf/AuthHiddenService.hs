  Module:      Network.Ricochet.Protocol.Protobuf.AuthHiddenService
  Description: AuthHiddenService.proto messages and their lenses

These types and lenses are useful for dealing with protobuf messages sent in
relation with @im.ricochet.auth.hidden-service@ channels.  They are used to
prove ownership of a hidden service name by demonstrating ownership of a
matching private key.  This is used to authenticate as a known contact, or to
prove ownership of a service name before sending a contact request.

See <https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/doc/protocol.md#authhiddenservice ricochet’s protocol specification>.
