A wip Haskell library for http://ricochet.im[ricochet.im].

== Idea

We really like Ricochet but the application is a monolithic Qt-based one.

We are developing this library for those reasons:

* Different frontends – like ncurses
* Possibility to build bots
* Easier to extend the protocol using new channel types (adding these is meant to be easy using our library)

== Stability and Security

Don't use this project unless you are developing on it. It is probably neither stable nor secure and far from being finished.

== Building and Documentation

We recommend using nix:

[source,shell]
----
nix-shell shell.nix # for dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal haddock # documentation
cabal repl    # for playing around
----

== Get in touch!

* …with the https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet#other[original ricochet-developers]
* …with us: `#ricochet` on Freenode
